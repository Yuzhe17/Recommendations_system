# Recommendations with IBM

## Introduction
In this project, I will do data analysis on the user and articles interactions, and make recommendations to users about new articles.

## Files
data: a folder containing csv files on user-articles interactions and articles information.
recommender.py: a module containing the recommender class which you can import and make recommendations with in much the way you've interacted with scikit-learn.
rec_functions.py: a module containing different python functions that are used in the recommender class.

## Executing the program
To make recommendations for a user, run recommender.py

## Acknowledge 
Thanks to IBM for providing the dataset
